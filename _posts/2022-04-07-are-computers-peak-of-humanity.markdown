The title is bit misleading and are just there to harvest more clicks over some forums and bring my point to the Internet. The actually title should be "What Will Be The Future Of Computing?"

I was reading about [Human genome]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_genetics") on wikipedia after watching a live stream on biology the guy was engineer but he was talking about a book which he was reading on Biology.

I found out that Human DNA is 6GB, I know right it blows my mind 6GB that is like nothing in todays world, it can be easily transferable over seconds from one network to other. The design of the human body is unreal and shows the beauty of the nature. Biology is beautiful. Biology is technology and most important Biology is not centralized.

Tomorrow i was talking to one of my friend over IRC and he told me how he and his father were on national exhibition for some marketing stuff(meeting potential clients for his ERP and exchanging business info) and then some random guy approached them and starts piching his company to them and what exactly does his company do convert CSV to Html yes that his there whole product and they are charging money for this. 

This just make me sad and remind me of Ted Kaczynski quote from his book The Truth About Primitive Life: A Critique of Anarchoprimitivism:


> History is made by active, determined minorities, not by the majority, which seldom has a clear and consistent idea of what it really wants.


Are we actually moving forward was the web better before this companies came and started making you there product.There are people who genuinely loves technology and working for free to imporve it .But in the end are we winning over the nature. 


We can only win over nature if we acually works to make our techology better and faster which is going to take some time but we will do it at some point. This cannot be achieve by selling you some shitty products or by showing you some random ads or making the internet decentralized. This can only be achieve by learning how actually nature works and improving our technology over it.


> the days of usenet, irc, the web...even email (w PGP)...were amazing. centralizing discovery and identity into corporations really damaged the internet.
I realize I'm partially to blame, and regret it.


This just me make me laugh.

Will pipernet ever gonna exist? Maybe.

Imagine we all died from the next covid all that left are smartphones useless without any solar charger. The device held the information on the device that allowed you to breath underwater, a machine that pulls the water from air, a flying machine but all of this is runied when you need a wifi to connect.

STOP BUILDING SHITTY TECHNOLOGY.

If it centralizes power, it’s bad. If it decentralizes power, it’s good. Build technology that is inextricable from its narrative. Build technology that will give us freedom, not enslavement.

One axis to consider. Does this centralize or decentralize power? The power itself is unstoppable. How we divide it is a choice.

Now lets talk about real world problem, as born in a third world country i have seen poverty up close. I may give them empathy or help them with food but lets be real will it ever gonna end poverty?. I am from India so i am using the data available for my country on wikipedia. After India independece the infaltion never stopped (expect in 1976) maybe the reasons are bad govement, lazy people ,the population? well yes.But how can we solve? Tough Question i would say.

Lets try to break it down by looking over every important sectors. Human development index 0.65 pretty average. Literacy rate 74%. Now current population of India is 138 crores(1.38 billion) 74% of 138 crores is 96.2 crores and by Litrate they mean "a person aged seven and above who can both read and write with understanding in any language, is treated as literate"(according to censusindia.gov.in).

Now lets look at the unemployment rate 7.9% (according unemploymentinindia.cmie.com) and if we look at it state wise the highest is from Haryana and least is from chhattisgarh. I have never been to Haryana but I am guessing as it is close to punjab it may comes under farming state. But i currently live in chhattisgarh and seen poverty everywhere so is the data wrong? I dont know. 

So what is the solution? Is technology gonna help them? Is going to mars gonna save a kid from straving? maybe the resourses will grow hence the prices might go down. But lets not go there see the problem there are a alot i mean a alot of people(talking about population) and everyone wants to live a perfect life with his/her huband/wife(boyfriend/girlfriend) and honestly very few peoples actually gives a shit about poor people remind me of south park episode([The City Part Of The Town](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYV00xG-Vuo)). 

>“The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little."
-Franklin D. Roosevelt


So will giving a shit about them will actually gonna help? Maybe (But mostly no), but the best we can do is to try to educate the one who appricate it which is pretty thoug i mean everyone goes to goverment school when the goverment gifts bicycle to everyone, everyone is present the day goverment gifts the laptops but after that they sell them to the local market (I get it they need bread more then this but it can only provide the bread for a day but you can learn so much from this things) you can help the appreciative ones by maybe giving them some good books (please i'm not talking about those self-help books "think and grow rich").

>“You might be poor, your shoes might be broken, but your mind is a palace.”
― Frank McCourt

Just reading and writing is not enough to be called litrate it about understanding the nature. I'm telling you it feels good when you actually understand it. Poverty is not a easy problem to solve and I don't think that I'am qualifed enough to give you the solutions (I don't think anyone is).

Now back to my topic of technology I think most of the people who uses this products like CSV to HTML thing that i have already talked about are lyes under below middle class or middle class and this company loves to scam them over this things which you can find for free if you do some research.

STOP SCAMMING PEOPLE OVER THE NAME OF CHANGING THE WORLD!
