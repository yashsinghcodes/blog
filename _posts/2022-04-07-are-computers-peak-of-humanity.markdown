# Are Computers the Peak Of Humanity

The title is bit misleading and are just there harvest more clicks over some fourms and bring my point to the Internet. The actually title should be What Will Be The Future Of Computing?

I was reading about Human genome on wikipedia after watching a live stream on biology the guy was enigneer but he was talking about a book which he was reading on Biology.
I found out that Human DNA is 6GB, I know right it blows my mind 6GB that is like nothing in our era and it can be traffered over secounds from one network to other. But this not it human body is designed which in my sense is unreal and most important part is biology is not centralized.
